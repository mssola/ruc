Small implementation of a Git-like version control system (VCS) in Rust. This is
based on [these series of blog posts](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/), and the
main purpose for this repository is for me to learn Git internals while putting
Rust into practice.

If `git` had the meaning of "stupid", in catalan we can translate it as `ruc`,
which also has the (apparently mandatory) requirement met of calling Rust
projects with a leading "r".

*Work in progress*
